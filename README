This code can be used to compare performances of two Biometric Systems.
As an input two Similarity Matrices were given and based on the Genuine
and Imposter Scores Genuine/Imposter Score Distribution, CMC and DET curves
of the two systems can be plotted and compared. Find sample report on the
docx file.

The code can also be used to plot variation of False Acceptance Rate and
False Rejection Rate with Threshold Operating Points and compute FRR at a
particular FAR.

You will need IPython Notebook to open the .ipynb file. Use the following
to install it: pip install Ipython[all].

I have used a number of packages in this project.
Do $ pip install <package-name> to install the corresponding package.
